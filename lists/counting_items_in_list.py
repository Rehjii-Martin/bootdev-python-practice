""" Our players need a way to see how many copies of a specific item they have within their inventory!

Let's finish the get_item_counts function.

Within the loop, check if the items are a Potion, Bread, or Shortsword.
If you find a match, increment the corresponding counter, either potion_count, bread_count or shortsword_count. """
