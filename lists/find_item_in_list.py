# Problem
# Practice the "no-index" or "no-range" syntax:
    # for fruit in fruits:
    #     print(fruit)
# Assignment
# We need to check if a player has a specific item in their inventory. 
# In the contains_leather_scraps function, use the no-index syntax to iterate over each item in items. 
# If you find an item called Leather Scraps, set the found variable to True.

def contains_leather_scraps(items):
    found = False

    # don't touch above this line

    # ?

    # don't touch below this line

    return found
