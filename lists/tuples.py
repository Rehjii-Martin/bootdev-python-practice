# Assignment
# The Fantasy Quest character system needs a list of "heroes" to be able 
# to run the game properly. Someone wrote some pretty nasty code, and 
# the code in question creates a heroes list where every 3rd index 
# defines a new hero. First their name, then their age, then whether 
# or not they're an "elf". Restructure the heroes list into a list 
# of tuples by editing the syntax on lines 3 through 14, where each 
# tuple represents one hero and contains their data in the same order.
