# Boot.dev Python Practice

This repository mirrors the exercises I complete in the Boot.dev Python track.  
Each file contains:
- a short problem description
- my solution implementation
- minimal sanity tests using simple assertions

This repo serves as a record of daily learning and review across Python fundamentals:
- lists and sequences
- strings
- dictionaries and sets
- functions and control flow
- basic algorithms
